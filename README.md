# How to play?
       
Click 'Roll The Dice' to start your turn and roll a dice. 
The number you roll gets added to your turn's score, except if you roll a 1. 
If you roll a 1, you lose your turn's score, and it's the next player's turn. 
To secure your turn's score, click 'Hold'. 
This adds your turn's score to your total score. 
Be sure to click 'Hold' before you roll a 1, or you lose your turn's score! 
The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins!"
